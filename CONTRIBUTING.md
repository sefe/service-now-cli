# Contributing to Our Project
We welcome all contributions so want to make this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and we actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact us if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

We'd request that you detail bug reports with detail, background and sample code. Typically your report should include:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

Thanks!
